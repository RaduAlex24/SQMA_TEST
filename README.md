# Software Quality Testing
Welcome to my Software Quality Testing repository, a showcase of best practices in unit testing with Java. It features simple classes alongside their corresponding JUnit tests, demonstrating how to ensure our code behaves as expected. Unit tests are key to maintaining software quality, allowing us to verify individual parts of our code in isolation and catch bugs early in the development cycle. By exploring this repository, you'll gain a better understanding of the integral role testing plays in creating robust, reliable software.
